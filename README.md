# Project description

[//]: # (Press: Ctrl-Shift-V to compile)
### Task list:
1. Find more info about the binding for the Covid19;
2. To add nglview for PDB visualisation;
3. Cami is keep working with the articles, where mutagenesis is described for the protein-ligand complexes, looking specifically for the cases, where binding is increasing after the mutation;
4. Maxim will add an option to the web form, which will allow switching between initial complex structure and the one, that was obtained by the docking;
5. Hrishi will look into conservation of the protein residues.

### Finished:
1. Import list of questions about the binding from the google drive to the GitHub => all in the 'documentation' directiry
2. To add sliders to make it Jupyter free form => index.html/indes.js
3. Hrishi looked for the complexes, for which there are some examples of the increase/decrease of the affinity upon the mutation (F->A);

### Progress
- Protein and 3 nucleotides --> scored with attract and minimized
- The preliminary pipeline is ready

### Current Status
![alt text](https://github.com/sjdv1982/biohackathon-covid/blob/master/Current_Status.png?raw=true)

### Suggestion 
- it can be useful (or will it be useful?), to have a brief description of each cell on the status graph
- it will be useful to have a screenshot of a status graph after each session
