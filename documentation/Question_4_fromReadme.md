Question 4 : What RNA binding experiments have been performed with Nsp9, and what RNA sequences were being used? How long were they, and what was the composition?

1. [The nsp9 Replicase Protein of SARS-Coronavirus, Structure and Functional Insights](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.str.2004.01.016) 
--> RNA seq (A 20-mer oligoribonucleotide (CGACUCAUGGACCUUGGCAG) binds to Sars-Cov1 nsp9) <-- Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays <-- Low resolution expt
- Two structurally different dimers are observed in both of the two different crystal forms we have analyzed.
--> In one of the dimers, the interface is principally formed by the parallel association of the C-terminal alpha helices.
--> The second dimer observed in the crystals is formed by an interaction between beta strand 5 (residues 63–68) from both subunits zippering the two beta-barrels together.

2. [Formation of stable homodimer via the C-terminal α-helical domain of coronavirus nonstructural protein 9 is critical for its function in viral replication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.10.032) 
--> substitution mutation of a conserved Gly (G98) residue in the C-terminal α-helix domain with an Asp greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished its RNA-binding activity.
--> The structural characteristics of nsp9 suggested that its nucleic acid-binding activity is not strictly sequence-specific --> need to mine properly (Total 9 point mutations)

K10A and K90A => 10% RNA-binding activity  
K51A => 35% / 55%  binding activity to +RNA/-RNA  
Y31A and I95N => 80-100% binding activity  


TODO: find correspondant residues ID in Sars-Cov2 nsp9


3. [Variable Oligomerization Modes in Coronavirus Non-structural Protein 9](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.07.071) --> wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 and the Cys69Ala mutant have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank, with accession code 2J97 and 2J98, respectively. 
--> gel mobility-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements indicate that only the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, not the Cys69Ala mutant, binds strongly to single-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA. In order to assess a possible direct role of Cys69 in nucleic acid binding, this residue was also replaced by serine. Again, the mutant showed little or no affinity to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).
- We used the sulfate ions present in one of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 structures25 (PDB ID 1QZ8) to propose a binding mode for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). --> We also note that the residues that we propose to interact with the ssRNA on the basis of this model (Lys10, Lys50, Tyr51, Arg70, Tyr83, Lys88, and Arg107) are better conserved, on average, than the polypeptide sequence. (Numbering according to HCoV)

4. [Functional and Genetic Studies of the Substrate Specificity of Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus 3C-Like Proteinase](https://jvi.asm.org/content/84/14/7325) 
--> Replacement of P1-Gln with Asn at the nsp4-5, nsp5-6, nsp7-8, nsp8-9, and nsp9-10 sites, Glu at the nsp8-9 site, and His at the nsp15-16 site of IBV allowed the recovery of the corresponding infectious mutant virus and the 3CLpro-mediated cleavage of these mutant substrates, suggesting that IBV 3CLpro is able to accept Asn, Glu, and His instead of the conserved Gln residue at the P1 position of several cleavage sites. --> Slow and delayed growth but complete virus recovery

5. [Screening and druggability analysis of some plant metabolites against SARS-CoV-2: An integrative computational approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100367) 
-->The crucial binding sites of Nsp9 protein (39–73 region) are characterized by positively charged, glycine rich β-loops, which were proposed to be involved in RNA binding [105]. —> (Reference From the structure)
