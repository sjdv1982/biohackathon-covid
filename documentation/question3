# Question 3: What do RNA interface prediction programs predict as the binding site on the protein? How does this relate to conservation, positive charge, aromatics? 



## visualise the conserved residues identified in bibliography : check if the conserved residues form a patch on the protein surface?  => dom

## check in bibliography which servers for prediction of RNA-binding residues/patches are suitable for ssRNA (look at training set)  (Isaure)

## test webserver on known ssRNA-protein structures (Isaure)

## run few servers  (ex: iPNHOT, 2020), create consensus prediction (Isaure)
